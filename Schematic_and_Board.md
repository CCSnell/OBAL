All board data are shared and available at [EasyEDA](https://oshwlab.com/mohammad.hefny/Ardupilot-OBAL-FCB "EasyEDA"). You can order your board from there, or clone the board and make your modification and get your own board.

Board design is simple & straight forward. The board is simple. It is mainly an I2C bus shared between different sensors and a SPI bus for MP

There is also a switch that disable output of [PCA-9685](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/PCA9685.pdf) to prevent motor from spinning accedintly.

RC-In is recieved via 8 channels.


Board design is very straighforward.
