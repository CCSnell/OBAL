BROWN: Power Pins

Green: Mandatory Pins

Blue: Used but can be relocated in code.

Green Text: not used but can be used.

**Important Notice:** you can use PPM instead of PWM. This will save you pins GPIO (6, 12, 13, 16, 19, 20, 21, 26) and only GPIO 5 is used in this case.

To Know how to setup for PPM please refer to this PR: https://github.com/HefnySco/ardupilot/tree/tip_ppm
